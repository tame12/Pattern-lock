this is a ruby program...

description: this programs aims to mimic the sumsung phone screen-lock pattern, but uses a 3x3x3 grid instead of a 3x3. 
             as it is hard to display certain vectors, this program only allows vectors parallel to the x, y or z axis
rules:
1.each dot can only be used once
2.must use at least 5 dots (actual lock screen requires 4)
3.if a connection overlaps an unused dot, that unused dot will be used

instructions on how to use...

For each axis (xyz) select a number between 0-2
For example, 000 would mean x=0, y=0, z=0
Each dot can only be used once
Only vectors parallel to the x, y or z axis are allowed
